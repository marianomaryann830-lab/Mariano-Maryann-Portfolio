# My Portfolio

# About Me
I am Mary Ann Mariano, a BSIT 2A student with a passion for the simple joys in life. You'll often find me in the kitchen of our home, experimenting with flavors and creating dishes that bring smiles to my family's faces. Music is my constant companion, filling my days with rhythm and melody. And when I need a break, I occasionally shoot hoops, finding freedom and creativity on the basketball court. These hobbies are the threads that weave together the tapestry of who I am.

# Reflection
# Challenges Faced and Solutions
When I worked on my portfolio, I faced a few challenges. The first challenge was choosing what to include. I wanted to add many works, but I realized it would look too crowded. To solve this, I selected only the best and most important works that could show my skills clearly. This way, my portfolio became more organized and easy to follow.

Another challenge was the design. At first, I was unsure how to make it look neat and professional. I solved this by looking at simple templates online and using them as a guide. I also kept the layout clean and minimal so it would not look messy.

Time management was also a challenge. Working on the portfolio took effort and focus, and I sometimes felt overwhelmed. To solve this, I made a small plan and worked on one part each day. This helped me finish on time without stress.

Through these challenges, I learned to be more organized and patient. Solving problems step by step made the process easier, and I was happy with the final result of my portfolio.

# Future Improvements
If I improve my portfolio in the future, I will make it more creative and updated. Right now, it is simple, but I know it can look better. One improvement is to add visuals like pictures, charts, or short videos. This will make my portfolio more interesting and show my work more clearly.

Another improvement is to keep updating it. A portfolio should not stay the same, so I will add new projects and achievements whenever I have them. This way, my portfolio will always look fresh and reflect my growth.

I also want to improve the design. I can learn more about colors, layouts, and simple styles that make it look professional. Even small changes, like better spacing and clear titles, can make it easier to read.

In the future, I would also like to create a digital version of my portfolio. That way, I can share it online and make it more accessible.

Overall, I will focus on creativity, regular updates, and a cleaner design. These changes will make my portfolio more effective and professional.
